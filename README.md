# github-org-find-replace

Runs a find-replace across a GitHub organization using the API. Good for simpler strings. Creates pull requests.

Do `./scripts/install` to set it up (python 3 and pipenv required) and `GITHUB_API_TOKEN=<token> ./scripts/run` to use it.
Use `./scripts/run --help` to see what the options are.
